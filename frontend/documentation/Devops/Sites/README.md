## Sites

Currently, there are three known sites actively using the SciCat project. If you are also using the product, please feel free to submit a pull request to add your site here:

1. Paul Scherrer Insitut \(PSI\)
2. European Spallation Source \(ESS\)
3. MaxIV

Inside these folders, there may be site specific information that is relevant to a SciCat installation or just for general usage. An example of this could be your build pipeline,  specifics for testing or deployment and/or administrative guidelines.
