# Login

There are two types of account associated with the DataCatalog: Functional and User. A `functional` account will primarily be used by software and system administrators to deal with backups and other tasks.

User accounts are tied into the login system that is used by your institution, for example: Active Directory. You are able to log in to the system using the same credentials you use on that account.
