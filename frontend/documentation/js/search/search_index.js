Unsure if you can hardcode a docker IP (probably not a great idea).\nRunning\nRunning locally: ng serve (catamel will need to be running)\nRunning through docker: docker build -t  .; docker run \nAuto generated below\nThis project was generated with angular-cli version 1.0.0-beta.30.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.\nDeploying to GitHub Pages\nRun ng github-pages:deploy to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the angular-cli use ng help or go check out the Angular-CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
